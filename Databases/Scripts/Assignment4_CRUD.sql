--1.Write an INSERT statement that adds this row to the Categories table:
--CategoryName:Brass
--Code the INSERT statement so SQL Server automatically generates the value for the CategoryID column.

SELECT *
INTO CategoriesCopy
FROM Categories;

SELECT *
FROM Customers

SELECT *
INTO ProductsCopy
FROM Products

DELETE ProductsCopy

INSERT INTO CategoriesCopy
   (CategoryName)
VALUES ('Brass');

SELECT *
FROM CategoriesCopy;

--2.Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the row you just added to the Categories table. This statement should change the CategoryName column to �Woodwinds�, and it should use the CategoryID column to identify the row.
UPDATE CategoriesCopy
SET CategoryName = 'Woodwinds'
WHERE CategoryID = 5;

--3. Write a DELETE statement that deletes the row you added to the Categories table in exercise 1. This statement should use the CategoryID column to identify the row.
DELETE CategoriesCopy
WHERE CategoryID = 5;

--4.Write an INSERT statement that adds this row to the Products table:

--ProductID:                    The next automatically generated ID
--CategoryID:                  4
--ProductCode:                dgx_640
--ProductName:               Yamaha DGX 640 88-Key Digital Piano
--Description:                  Long description to come.
--ListPrice:                      799.99
--DiscountPercent:           0 (this is the default)
--DateAdded:                  Today�s date/time.

--Use a column list for this statement.
INSERT INTO ProductsCopy
   (CategoryID, ProductCode, ProductName, Description, ListPrice, DiscountPercent, DateAdded)
VALUES(4, 'dgx_640', 'Yamaha DGX 640 88-Key Digital Piano', 'Long description to come.', 799.99, 0, GETDATE())

SELECT *
FROM ProductsCopy;
--5. Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the product you added in exercise 4. This statement should change the DiscountPercent column from 0% to 35%.
UPDATE ProductsCopy
SET DiscountPercent = 35
WHERE ProductID = 11;

--6.Write a DELETE statement that deletes the row in the Categories table that has an ID of 4. When you execute this statement, it will produce an error since the category has related rows in the Products table. To fix that, precede the DELETE statement with another DELETE statement that deletes all products in this category.

DELETE Products
WHERE  CategoryID = 3;

DELETE Categories
WHERE CategoryID = 3;


-- 7. Write an INSERT statement that adds this row to the Customers table:

--EmailAddress:              rick@raven.com

   (EmailAddress, [Password], FirstName, LastName)
VALUES('rick@raven.com', '', 'Rick', 'Raven')

--8. Write an UPDATE statement that modifies the Customers table. Change the password column to �secret� for the customer with an email address of rick@raven.com.
UPDATE Customers
SET [Password] = 'secret'
WHERE EmailAddress = 'rick@raven.com';

UPDATE Customers
SET [Password] = 'reset'

--10. Open the script named CreateMyGuitarShop.sql Download CreateMyGuitarShop.sql. Then, run this script. That should restore the data that�s in the database.
